# Investigating Task Arithmetic for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval

This repository contains the code for the experiments of the paper "Investigating Task Arithmetic for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval".

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Scripts`: the code used to run the experiments, described in detail below.
- `Results`: the performance obtained by our approach
